Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering can be described as the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications. This means applying software based approaches to solve real life problems. 
It is important in industry to ensure the development of reliable, efficient and scalable software based solutions that meet the needs of the company, industry or user.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Birth of structured programming - Good and maintainable code with different control structures such as loops
Rise of Object Oriented Programming - Made software more modular and reusable
Agile and DevOps - more iterative development, improved flexibility and collaboration

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - Get and document info about the design specifications and requirements
Design - Design the software architecture and user interface
Implementation - Write code to solve the problem
Testing - Various tests to check the quality of the code written. Does it meet requirements
Deployment - Release software to customers
Maintenace - Updates, support

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodologies - Are linear and sequencial, rigid and difficult to implement and has limited customer involvement. For large Government projects and Banking
Agile Methodologies - Iterative and incremental, flexible and can be easily changed throughout development and required feedback from customers for improvement. For web and mobile apps

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - Writes code and implements software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer - Tests the project to validate the quality as per requirements
Project Manager - Oversees the planning, structure and architecture of the whole project

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs - Are the coding platforms. For editing, debugging and running code. E.g Visual Studio
VCS - Are to keep track of changes made to the project code. E.g Git Hub

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements - The project users may change their requirements on how the project needs to operate, which may cause project delays. This requires effective communication to avoid
Having Tight Deadlines - Having a small time frame to complete the project can compromise the quality. Task prioritization is key to solve this

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - Testing components of software
Integration testing - Testing component interactions
system testing - Testing the whole software system
acceptance testing - Tests against the given specifications and requirements
Helps identify and fix problems in the project

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the ability to design, structure and specify meaningful prompts when using AI tools in order to get the best possible response. It helps the user get the best non-vague or confusing answer from AI. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about science"
To improve this prompt we can say "Explain the basics of Biomedical Science principles" to focus the prompt on a specific field
